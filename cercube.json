I have no other choice except to modify CercubePlus's bundle ID. As a result, you won't be able to install CercubePlus directly through AltStore. You still can download the IPA like normal though.\n\nFull infomation about CercubePlus (Cercube+) is available on my Github: https://github.com/qnblackcat/CercubePlus/\n\nCredits: Please keep the Credits if you re-up CercubePlus! \n- Alfhaily for Cercube.\n- Galactic-Dev for the original iSponsorBlock, @Luewii for his fork of iSponsorBlock (which works in jailed mode).\n- PoomSmart for YouRememberCaption, YTClassicVideoQuality, YTNoCheckLocalNetwork, YTSystemAppearance, YTUHD, YouPiP and Return YouTube Dislike.\n- level3tjg for YTNoHoverCards.\n\nKnown issues:\n- Hide Cast button may not work.\n- YTUHD: Stuttering on 2K/4K videos.\n- YouPiP (iOS 14.0 - 14.4.2): due to Apple's fault, you may encounter the speedup-bug as described here. The bug also happens when you try to play multi-sources of sound at the same time. Enable Legacy PiP is a workaround. Note that Legacy PiP removes UHD quality and breaks the default video quality feature of uYou.
