The Github Action that was updating the AltStore Repos/Sources has also been disabled.


Ultimately, this site had already fallen into a state of disrepair and I don't have the time or interest to improve it when other, more polished alternatives exist. After all, this site was first made over 5 years ago! Which is absolutely crazy that it's been that long since AltStore was first introduced to the world of iOS Sideloading.

It was a pleasure helping innovate and improve with you all, and I hope one day 3rd-party App Stores arrive globally, free for all users to enjoy.


# Welcome to Quark Sources!
