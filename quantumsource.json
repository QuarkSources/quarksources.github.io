Unfortunately, there has been no easy way for people to play these games whenever they so desired...that is, until now. GBA4iOS was made for one purpose and one purpose only: to help everyone relive their favorite games from their past. Now, every where you take your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, you can bring and play your classic games with you, giving you practically endless hours of entertainment!\n\nSo that's great and all, but what features does GBA4iOS actually have? Far too many to list in one App Store description, but here are some of the biggest:\n\n\u2022 Multiplayer (iPhone 5 or newer, iPad 4 or newer). GBA4iOS allows you to link with other players nearby and play with them, allowing you to unlock or experience certain events in games that are unavailable to just one player! Plus, nothing is cooler than playing games with your friends.\n\n\u2022 Save States. Ever get frustrated when a game requires you to save only at certain points? Well be frustrated no longer, GBA4iOS fully supports Save States, allowing you to save anywhere in the game and resume right from that point later. Even better, you can protect certain save states so you never accidentally overwrite them (and as everyone knows losing game data is one of the worst things in the world).\n\n\u2022 Cheat Codes. Sometimes games are just too hard, and you need a little boost to help defeat it. GBA4iOS allows you to input and use GameShark, Action Replay, Code Breaker, and Game Genie codes as you see fit. Don't worry, we won't judge!\n\n\u2022 Fast Forward (iPhone 4s or newer, iPad 2 or newer, iPod Touch 5th Gen). Don't you wish there was a way to speed up long cutscenes in games, or to reduce the time doing boring tasks in the game? Well, now there is! GBA4iOS allows you to \"Fast Forward\" through slow parts of the game, allowing you to get back to the fun even quicker.\n\n\u2022 Customizable Controller Skins. Want to change the look of the controller to something more personal? No worries, you can download a multitude of new controller skins from within the app, or download almost countless more from the web! You'll definitely be able to find a controller skin you like.\n\n\u2022 Dropbox Sync. Have multiple devices, or worried something will happen to your games? Dropbox Sync solves both these issues! When enabled, GBA4iOS will sync your game saves, save states, and cheat codes to Dropbox, keeping any and all your devices up to date with your latest changes. Plus, this means your game data is always backed up in the cloud, so if something happens to your device, your data is safe.\n\n\u2022 MFi Controller Support. Sometimes, touchscreen buttons just aren't good enough for the level of precision needed by some games. Luckily, GBA4iOS supports MFi Controllers, allowing you to connect and use physical controllers with your games! Now you can beat that final boss without a sweat.\n\nAll this and more ensures that GBA4iOS will give you the best portable gaming experience, hands down. So what are you waiting for, download GBA4iOS now and enjoy reliving your favorite classic games immediately!", "iconURL": "https://i.imgur.com/SBrqO9g.png", "tintColor": "78209d", "size": 7924507, "screenshotURLs": ["https://i.imgur.com/L4H0yM3.png", "https://i.imgur.com/UPGYLVr.png", "https://i.imgur.com/sWpUAii.png", "https://i.imgur.com/UwnDXRc.png"]}, {"name": "RetroArch", "bundleIdentifier": "com.libretro.dist.ios.RetroArch", "developerName": "libretro", "subtitle": "Cross-platform, sophisticated frontend for emulation.", "version": "1.9.0", "versionDate": "2020-08-07", "versionDescription": "Many bug fixes and quality of life improvements.

Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.\r\n* **Reclaiming space**: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.\r\n* **Disposable mode**: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select \"Run without saving changes\" to start VM in \"disposable mode.\" In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped. (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* Reminder: for troubleshooting common Windows install issues (such as no networking), please check out the [guide](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/windows-10) or [this guide](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/ubuntu-20-04) for Ubuntu install issues.\r\n* If you manually added `highmem=on` or `highmem=off` to your QEMU Machine Properties as a workaround to issues in a previous release, please remove it.\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.2.x will be the last update to support iOS 11-13.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.2.x. After that, iOS 14+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.4)\r\n* Fixed isolated network mode with new vmnet backend (#4022)\r\n* Fixed some USB devices not showing up for USB capture (#3975)\r\n* (iOS) Added tap to click with Apple Pencil (thanks @luken11)\r\n* (macOS) Workaround a SwiftUI freeze then crash in the home view when the scrollbar is visible (#3612)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an error loading Apple Virtualization VMs after updating from macOS 11 to macOS 12 (#4023)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed secondary click using Control+Click on the VM list (#4018)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.3)\r\n* Disabled screenshots for GL virtual machines (workaround for a crash that occurs, this will be re-enabled in a future update once the crash is triaged)\r\n* (iOS) Pass through Esc key on external keyboard when VoiceOver is in use (#3940)\r\n* (macOS) Use correct scaling when HiDPI is enabled (#3968)\r\n* (macOS) Fix toolbar overlapping top of screen when \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar in full screen\" is unchecked in system preferences (#3919)\r\n* (macOS) When bridged networking is selected, default the interface to \"en0\" (#3945)\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: clarify that Linux kernel and initrd must be uncompressed if Apple Virtualization is used\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.2)\r\n* Add \"disposable mode\" (see highlights for more information) (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Do not enable UEFI for unsupported architectures (#3976)\r\n* Fix broken play button in sidebar (#3980)\r\n* Fix \"Error -1 while loading VM state\" on resume caused by usbredir (#3979)\r\n* Various UI tweaks and typo fixes (#3984)\r\n* Fixed pausing without saving state\r\n* Fixed showing warning prompt when VM is paused but not saved\r\n* (iOS) Detect if UTM is installed without AltStore and AltJIT will not attempt to be used.\r\n* (iOS) Reduced build size by 10% (thanks @Halo-Michael) (#3934)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference option to revert Caps Lock behaviour to pre 3.2.0 (#3974)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.1)\r\n* Fixed boot of RISC-V virt platform (thanks @wegank)\r\n* Remove `highmem=off` default property which is no longer needed on macOS 12.4+ and iOS 15.5+ (it will still be used on lower versions) (#3941, #3946)\r\n* Caps lock state will now be synchronized when mouse is captured (note that if mouse is captured before the guest OS has booted up, the state will be out of sync) (#3415)\r\n* Re-introduce option to disable auto-resolution when SPICE tools is installed (#3938)\r\n* When discarding unsaved settings, do not delete any disk image not created by UTM (#3587)\r\n* Fix downloading of UTM zip files when the URL does not end in \".zip\" (#3953)\r\n* (macOS) When importing a disk image, do not silently overwrite an existing image of the same name (#3866)\r\n* (macOS) Added option to reclaim unused space from disk image and to compress a disk image (macOS 12+ only)\r\n* (macOS) On the VM list, the start button will now change to a spinner when the VM is starting and will disappear when the VM has started.
