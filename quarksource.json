Due to the need to mmap the entire ROM into memory, older devices with only 256MB of RAM are not supported. These devices include the iPod Touch 4, iPad 1, iPhone 3GS, and anything below those devices.",

The DPAD works in 8-axis way. It can also be toggled into a joystick.\n\nExternal bluetooth game controllers are supported. Make sure your game controller is connected (System Settings->Bluetooth). To customize button bindings, go to iDOS in landscape mode, tap on bluetooth icon on the auto-hiding top bar.\n\nMOUSE\n\n* The screen area serves as a trackpad for moving mouse pointer.\n* Tap on the screen for left click.

      "localizedDescription": "Classic Gaming, Meet iOS.\n\nWhile iPhone and iOS have brought a new era of gaming upon us, there will always be room in our hearts for those classic games from decades ago. Unfortunately, there has been no easy way for people to play these games whenever they so desired...that is, until now. GBA4iOS was made for one purpose and one purpose only: to help everyone relive their favorite games from their past. Now, every where you take your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, you can bring and play your classic games with you, giving you practically endless hours of entertainment!\n\nSo that's great and all, but what features does GBA4iOS actually have? Far too many to list in one App Store description, but here are some of the biggest:\n\n• Multiplayer (iPhone 5 or newer, iPad 4 or newer). GBA4iOS allows you to link with other players nearby and play with them, allowing you to unlock or experience certain events in games that are unavailable to just one player! Plus, nothing is cooler than playing games with your friends.\n\n• Save States. Ever get frustrated when a game requires you to save only at certain points? Well be frustrated no longer, GBA4iOS fully supports Save States, allowing you to save anywhere in the game and resume right from that point later. Even better, you can protect certain save states so you never accidentally overwrite them (and as everyone knows losing game data is one of the worst things in the world).\n\n• Cheat Codes. Sometimes games are just too hard, and you need a little boost to help defeat it. GBA4iOS allows you to input and use GameShark, Action Replay, Code Breaker, and Game Genie codes as you see fit. Don't worry, we won't judge!\n\n• Fast Forward (iPhone 4s or newer, iPad 2 or newer, iPod Touch 5th Gen). Don't you wish there was a way to speed up long cutscenes in games, or to reduce the time doing boring tasks in the game? Well, now there is! GBA4iOS allows you to \"Fast Forward\" through slow parts of the game, allowing you to get back to the fun even quicker.\n\n• Customizable Controller Skins. Want to change the look of the controller to something more personal? No worries, you can download a multitude of new controller skins from within the app, or download almost countless more from the web! You'll definitely be able to find a controller skin you like.\n\n• Dropbox Sync. Have multiple devices, or worried something will happen to your games? Dropbox Sync solves both these issues! When enabled, GBA4iOS will sync your game saves, save states, and cheat codes to Dropbox, keeping any and all your devices up to date with your latest changes. Plus, this means your game data is always backed up in the cloud, so if something happens to your device, your data is safe.\n\n• MFi Controller Support. Sometimes, touchscreen buttons just aren't good enough for the level of precision needed by some games. Luckily, GBA4iOS supports MFi Controllers, allowing you to connect and use physical controllers with your games! Now you can beat that final boss without a sweat.\n\nAll this and more ensures that GBA4iOS will give you the best portable gaming experience, hands down. So what are you waiting for, download GBA4iOS now and enjoy reliving your favorite classic games immediately!",
